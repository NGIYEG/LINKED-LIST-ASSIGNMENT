This C program checks for duplicates in an array of integers using a simple nested loop approach. The function containsDuplicate takes the array and its size as input, then iterates through each element in the array. For each element, it compares it with every subsequent element using a nested loop. If a pair of elements is found to be equal, indicating a duplicate, the function returns true. If the nested loops complete without finding any duplicates, the function returns false. The main function demonstrates this by applying it to an example array, printing whether the array contains duplicates or not. This straightforward approach, while functional, may not be the most efficient for large arrays, and there are more optimized algorithms for duplicate detection
