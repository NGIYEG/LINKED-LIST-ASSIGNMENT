This C program finds the single element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice. The singleNumber function initializes a variable result to zero and then uses a loop to iterate through the array. Within the loop, the XOR operation (^) is applied to each element of the array and the current result. Since XORing an element with itself cancels out (resulting in zero), and XORing with zero doesn't change the value, this process effectively identifies the single element that appears only once. The main function demonstrates the functionality by applying the singleNumber function to an example array and prints the result. In the provided example array {4, 2, 7, 2, 4}, the single element 7 is identified and printed. The XOR operation leverages the property that XORing the same value twice yields zero, making it a concise approach for finding the unique element
