This C program rotates an array to the right by a specified number of steps (k) using an in-place reversal algorithm. It defines a reverse function that swaps elements between specified start and end indices in the array. The rotate function handles cases where k is greater than the array size, ensuring a valid rotation. The program demonstrates the rotation by applying the rotate function to an example array and then prints both the original and rotated arrays. The three-step reversal process efficiently achieves the right rotation without requiring additional memory allocation.
