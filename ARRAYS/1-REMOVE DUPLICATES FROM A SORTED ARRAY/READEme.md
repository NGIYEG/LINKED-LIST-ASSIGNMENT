This C program removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place using O(1) extra memory. The removeDuplicates function takes an array and its size as input, iterates through the array, and updates the array in-place by removing duplicates. The variable uniqueIndex keeps track of the last unique element's index, and if the current element is different from the previous one, it increments uniqueIndex and updates the array accordingly. The main function demonstrates the functionality by applying it to an example array, printing the original array, the array after removing duplicates, and the new length of the modified array. The program efficiently modifies the array in-place without allocating additional memory.
