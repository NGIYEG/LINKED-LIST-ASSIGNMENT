This C code defines a linked list and implements a function to reverse the linked list in place. The Node structure represents a node in the linked list with an integer input1 and a pointer next to the next node. The reverse function takes a pointer to the head of the list and reverses the list by adjusting the next pointers of each node. The push function adds a new node with the given data at the beginning of the list by dynamically allocating memory for the new node. The printList function prints the elements of the linked list. In the main function, a linked list is created by pushing four elements (9, 10, 11, 12) onto the list. The original linked list is printed, then reversed, and the reversed list is printed again.
